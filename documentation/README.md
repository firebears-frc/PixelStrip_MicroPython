# PixelStrip_MicroPython

PixelStrip is a [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) module for controlling WS2812 RGB LEDs on the [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).  These LEDs are also known as  [NeoPixels](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide). The PixelStrip library allows you to add Animations to the strip.  Multiple strips can have separate animations that run in parallel.

Note that the included `npxl.py` module is a rough clone of AdaFruit's [Neopixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel) for [CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython).
